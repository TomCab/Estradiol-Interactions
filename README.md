# Estradiol-Interactions

Software for analysis of interactions between proteins and 17Î²-estradiol.

In this repository there are mainly scripts (Java, Python and Bash) that help to manage and extract information from text files containing either:

a) protein sequences, or
b) results from several analysis tools (e.g. LigAlign, PLIP)

These scripts are part of the Project Beta-Clean at the University of Applied Sciences Mittweida (Germany)
